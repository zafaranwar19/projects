Just a theoretical experiment
<br><br>
A given company has not implemented all of computer science and engineering and artificial intelligence and other concepts
<br><br>
So can we do the following?
<br><br>
Take 200 or some number of different textbooks of computer science and engineering an artificial intelligence books then train artificial intelligence model and create a technical paper long technical paper
<br><br>
Then I will take a code base from git Repository and ask Gemini to summarize technical paper on what the project does from high level to low level
<br><br>
Now will use artificial intelligence system to compare both technical papers and find out which parts of computer science and engineering summary is missing from the get repository summary. This way we can understand which concepts of computer science and engineering the GitHub repository maybe a very large Repository depends upon
<br><br>
And a given company has millions of lines of code and we can summarize what parts of computer science engineering are most used least used and not used at all and so artificial intelligence Concepts as well we can do the same, security Concepts as well we can do the same.
<br><br>
It can also be used to understand patents research papers published are related to which part of the scientific knowledge Etc.
