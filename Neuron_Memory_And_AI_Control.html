I think for each neurons along with weights and activation values, what happens when we add a set of memory vectors that represent an area of memory a given neuron operates on? 

<br><br>It can only represent values from that area defined by those vectors. 

<br><br>These vectors are stored in a very large timeseries vector database. Then, link these time series values to models' accuracies' graphs. 

<br><br>Lots of humans can visually view and add tags for the most accurate answers. Now we get accuracies tagged by Humans. 

<br><br>Modifying these time series values will modify responses of the AI model. 

<br><br>Then some way we might be able to remove inaccuracies from the model. Having memory vectors makes model huge but gives us ability to flex it the way we want. 

<br><br>
Did it sound interesting?
    <br><br>
    Can we also add reasoning vectors, to each neuron?
    <br><br>
    It's much more fascinating to me. 
    <br><br>
    We can fine tune its reasoning ability fairly quickly and easily in the long-run. 
    <br><br>
    May be some small proof of concept from scratch would show some results for further research.
